# ADR-003: Load Testing and Performance Benchmarking Strategy

**Date:** 2025-07-19

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

The invoice processing pipeline has been hardened, but its performance under high load is unknown. To ensure the system can handle production volumes efficiently and cost-effectively, we need a strategy for load testing and performance benchmarking.

## Decision

We will implement a load testing strategy using a combination of a dedicated test data generator and an orchestration script.

1.  **Test Data Generator:** A Python script (`generate_test_data.py`) will be created to generate a configurable number of realistic-looking PDF invoices. This script will use a library like `faker` to generate plausible data and `reportlab` to create the PDF documents.
2.  **Load Test Orchestrator:** A Python script (`run_load_test.py`) will be created to orchestrate the load test.
    *   **Interface:** It will accept the number of invoices to generate and the level of parallelism for uploads as command-line arguments.
    *   **Logic:** The script will first call the test data generator. It will then upload the generated files to the main GCS bucket in parallel using a thread pool to simulate a high-volume scenario.
3.  **Performance Monitoring:** During the load test, we will monitor the following key metrics in Cloud Monitoring:
    *   End-to-end processing time per invoice (from GCS upload to BigQuery insertion).
    *   Workflow execution success and failure rates.
    *   Cloud Function execution times and resource utilization.
    *   Document AI processing latency.
    *   BigQuery insertion latency.
4.  **Benchmarking:** We will execute the load test with various invoice volumes (e.g., 100, 1,000, 10,000) and record the performance metrics for each run. This will establish a performance baseline and help us identify any bottlenecks.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   **Confidence in Scalability:** Provides a clear understanding of the system's performance characteristics and its ability to handle production loads.
-   **Bottleneck Identification:** Helps us proactively identify and address any performance bottlenecks before they impact users.
-   **Cost Optimization:** Allows us to analyze resource utilization under load and make informed decisions to optimize costs.
-   **Repeatable Process:** Creates a repeatable and automated process for performance testing, which can be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline in the future.

**Negative:**
-   **Test Data Realism:** The generated test data may not perfectly represent the variety and complexity of real-world invoices. This is an acceptable trade-off for having a controlled and repeatable test environment.
-   **Cost of Testing:** Executing large-scale load tests will incur costs for the use of GCP services. This is a necessary investment to ensure production readiness.
